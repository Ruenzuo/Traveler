#### Description

Traveler is an API client for Bungie's Destiny API written in Swift. It is pretty much work in progress at the moment, but I'm planning on implementing most of the endpoints [available](http://bungienetplatform.wikia.com/wiki/Endpoints).

#### Caveats

* Some endpoints require you to be [authorised](http://bungienetplatform.wikia.com/wiki/API_Details), this is currently handled by a view controller. Not pretty, I know.
* I'm still learning Swift and this is pretty much my first Framework, so ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

#### Try it!

1. Get an API key at [bungie.net](https://www.bungie.net/en/User/API).
2. Use your API key [here](https://github.com/Ruenzuo/Traveler/blob/master/TravelerExample/TravelerExample/Source/AppDelegate.swift#L18).
3. ???
4. Profit!
